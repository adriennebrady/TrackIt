## Project name:

## Project description:

Personal inventory tracker that allows users to create virtual furniture, like a cabinet or fridge, and create containers inside, such as shelves. Once the container is created, the user simply adds their items inside. From here, finding items is simple. The user can quickly search the name of the item they wish to find and they are brought right to the exact location. The inventory tracker stores user’s items using their usernames and passwords as identifiers.
If the containers could be recursive that would be ideal, ie letting you create containers inside containers for cabinets with dividers in shelves for example.  Another possible feature: give the option to put tags on an item, which would be searched if no names match. 
Example: what if the user calls an item power cable, but forgets and searches for a power cord. So instead they can tag it when creating with "power" "cord" "cable" "charging". And it might come up if any of those match the search
Furniture pieces will have descriptors that identify the location of the element within the house as well as the color, size, etc. (?)
Possible search algorithm to list all items per room, furniture piece, or all items in the house
We could have a drop down to filter search results, like search by room, search by item
We should have a login screen so diff accounts have diff furniture
Possible SQL for handling database of people’s furniture and items
If we need more features to add, we could have options to add expiration date to items inside the fridge with maybe a countdown to when they expire
